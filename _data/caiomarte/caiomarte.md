quote: Driving change relies on 3 things: learning, doing, and sharing. When we learn, we outgrow our thoughts. When we do, we outgrow ourselves. When we share, we outgrow our existence by reaching others. And that ultimately creates change in the world. My legacy will be to keep the flywheel going. # no longer than 100 characters, avoid using quotes(") to guarantee the format remains the same.
